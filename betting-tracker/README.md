# BetMetrics

A full-stack application to track your sports bets.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies from the root of the `betting-tracker` directory:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server from the root of the `betting-tracker` directory:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the frontend and backend servers. You can then access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the frontend and backend servers in development mode.
-   `npm run start:backend`: Starts only the backend server.
-   `npm run start:frontend`: Starts only the frontend development server.
-   `npm run build:frontend`: Builds the frontend for production.
-   `npm run lint:frontend`: Lints the frontend code.
-   `npm run preview:frontend`: Previews the production build.
